# CNN_GRU
Using a CNN with Grated recurrent units and Time distributed wrappers over MNIST data

I am using MNIST data here to test this new Convolutional Architecture that uses :
4 Convolutional layers Time wrapped
3 GRU layers

I am using 3 epochs and running it 3 times each resulting in total of 9 epochs. 

The total Loss calculated here is 3.0515 which is lowest you might get. you can edit the epochs and layers to experiment further.
